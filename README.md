# cljsjs-hosted
This repo hosts the contents of [cljsjs](https://github.com/cljsjs/packages) packages.

Its main usage is for self-host clojurescript.

The files are hosted by `gh-pages` at: https://viebel.github.io/cljsjs-hosted

For instance the `moment` package is at: https://viebel.github.io/cljsjs-hosted/cljsjs/moment/production/moment.min.inc.js

The rule for the full url of a package is:

`https://viebel.github.io/cljsjs-hosted/cljsjs/<package-name>/production/<package-name>.min.inc.js`

where `package-name` is the package name with hyphens `-` instead of dots `.`
